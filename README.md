# ecse-321-project-F20
An online shopping gallery

This was originally a term project in McGill's ECSE 321 course for Fall 2020. Other contributors were: 
1. Xirui Zhang - xirui.zhang@mail.mcgill.ca
2. Kaicheng Wu - kaichengwu8101@hotmail.com
3. Kaan Gure - kaan.gure@mail.mcgill.ca
4. Zeyang Xu - xuzeyanggg@gmail.com

The original work will be made available publicly. I have since added to and modified this project to my personal preference.
